# "Steroid Efficacy and Risks"

The conclusion reached in the transcript about taking steroids is nuanced and highlights both the efficacy and risks involved. The speaker starts by acknowledging that steroids are highly effective for muscle gain, significantly more so than natural alternatives like creatine. However, he emphasizes that the reality of using steroids is more complicated than just the benefits they offer.

Several key points emerge:

1. **Honesty vs. Misleading Narratives**: While more fitness influencers are being open about their steroid use, many do not discuss the potential downsides, leading to a skewed perception among those who may consider steroid use themselves.
2. **Health Risks**: Steroids can have a profound impact on physical and mental health, including cardiovascular risks, liver damage, hormonal imbalances, psychological effects, and potential long-term effects on intelligence and brain health.
3. **Cycle of Use**: There’s a cycle of dependence linked to steroid use. While users can see significant gains, they may struggle with self-image and experience muscle loss when they stop, leading many to feel compelled to return to steroids.
4. **Personal Decision**: Ultimately, the speaker indicates that while steroids can be used in a “healthier” way with monitoring and caution, they are inherently less safe than remaining natural. He stresses that the decision to use steroids should be taken seriously and considers various factors such as age, training experience, and personal health.
5. **Experimenting with Natural Gains**: The speaker also shares his decision to pursue a year of natural training to evaluate his potential gains without steroids, suggesting that many individuals might not have fully explored their natural limits before considering enhancement.

In the end, while steroids are presented as effective in achieving muscle growth, the speaker outlines considerable risks and encourages a thoughtful, informed approach rather than a blanket endorsement or dismissal. The takeaway is that although steroids can provide significant results, they come with substantial risks that should not be overlooked. Thus, the conclusion is not that "it's not that bad," but rather that the consequences must be weighed carefully against the benefits.
