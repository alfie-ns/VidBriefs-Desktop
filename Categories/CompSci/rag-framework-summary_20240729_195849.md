# **RAG Framework Summary**

## Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) are widely used and demonstrate both impressive capabilities and notable shortcomings. Marina Danilevsky, a Senior Research Scientist at IBM Research, introduces the RAG framework designed to enhance the accuracy and recency of LLMs.

## Key Issues with LLMs

1. **Lack of Sourcing:** LLMs often provide answers without citing sources, which leads to questions about the validity of their information.
2. **Outdated Information:** Without regular updates, responses can become outdated, misleading users.

### Anecdote Example

Marina shares a personal story about answering her children's question regarding the planet with the most moons. Historically, she would state that Jupiter has 88 moons, a fact she learned years ago, but which may no longer be accurate. A more current source might indicate that Saturn has 146 moons, highlighting the importance of sourcing and up-to-date information.

## The RAG Solution

The RAG framework introduces a retrieval step before the generation of answers:

- LLMs first query a content store to retrieve relevant information before generating a response.
- This allows LLMs to provide answers that are both accurate and evidence-based.

### Process Overview

1. **User Prompt:** User asks a question.
2. **RAG Process:**
   - The LLM retrieves relevant content from a store (this could be from the internet or a private document repository).
   - Combines the retrieved content with the user's question.
   - Generates a response grounded in evidence.

## Benefits of RAG

1. **Up-to-Date Information:** By updating the content store, LLMs can provide current answers without needing retraining.
2. **Credibility:** The model can now reference primary sources, reducing the possibility of hallucination (providing false information).
3. **Acknowledgment of Limitations:** With reliable source data, LLMs are encouraged to respond with "I don't know" when the information is not available, thus avoiding inaccurate responses.

## Challenges

While RAG positively impacts LLMs, its effectiveness depends on:

- The quality of the retrieval system to ensure high-quality grounding information.
- The capability of the generative model to provide comprehensive and accurate responses.

## Conclusion

The RAG framework is being pursued by researchers, including teams at IBM, to address critical challenges in large language models. Improved retrievers and generative capabilities promise a future with more reliable and relevant interactions in natural language processing.
