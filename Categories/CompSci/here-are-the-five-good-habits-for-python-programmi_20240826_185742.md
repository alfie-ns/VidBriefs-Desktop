Here are the five good habits for Python programming mentioned in the video:

1. **Use `if __name__ == "__main__"`:**
   - This ensures that code inside the module only runs when the module is executed directly, preventing unintended execution when the module is imported elsewhere.

2. **Define a `main` function:**
   - Organize your code by creating a main entry point function. This improves readability and structure by grouping functionality together, making it easier to manage and understand.

3. **Keep functions simple and reusable:**
   - Instead of writing complex functions that handle multiple tasks, separate concerns into distinct, reusable functions. This enhances code reusability and makes it easier to maintain and modify.

4. **Use type annotations:**
   - Adding type annotations helps clarify what types of arguments a function expects and what it returns, making the code self-documenting and reducing the chance of errors due to the wrong data types.

5. **Employ list comprehensions:**
   - Use list comprehensions for creating lists more efficiently and concisely. They can make the code faster and clearer, reducing the number of lines and improving readability when used thoughtfully.

These habits are aimed at improving code quality, readability, and maintainability in Python projects.
