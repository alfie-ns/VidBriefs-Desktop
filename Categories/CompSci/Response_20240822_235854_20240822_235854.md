To implement an AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) tree, which is a type of self-balancing binary search tree, you need to follow certain procedures for insertion, deletion, and maintaining the balance. Here's a concise guide:

### 1. Definition
An **AVL Tree** is a balanced binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. If the difference exceeds one, a rotation is performed to restore balance.

### 2. Basic Operations
#### a. Insertion
- **Insert the node** as you would in a normal binary search tree.
- **Update the heights** of the ancestors of the newly inserted node.
- **Balance the tree**:
  - Calculate the balance factor:  
    `BalanceFactor = Height(LeftSubtree) - Height(RightSubtree)`
  - If the balance factor is greater than 1 (left-heavy), check:
    - **Left-Left (LL):** Perform a right rotation.
    - **Left-Right (LR):** Perform a left rotation on the left child, then a right rotation.
  - If the balance factor is less than -1 (right-heavy), check:
    - **Right-Right (RR):** Perform a left rotation.
    - **Right-Left (RL):** Perform a right rotation on the right child, then a left rotation.
    
#### b. Deletion
- **Delete the node** as you would in a normal binary search tree.
- **Update the heights** of the ancestors of the deleted node.
- **Balance the tree** using the same process as in insertion, checking the balance factor and performing the necessary rotations.

### 3. Example Code
Here's a simple example of how to implement an AVL tree insertion in Python:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.value = key
        self.height = 1

class AVLTree:
    def insert(self, root, key):
        # Perform the normal BST insertion
        if not root:
            return Node(key)
        elif key < root.value:
            root.left = self.insert(root.left, key)
        else:
            root.right = self.insert(root.right, key)

        # Update the height of the ancestor node
        root.height = 1 + max(self.getHeight(root.left), self.getHeight(root.right))
        
        # Get the balance factor
        balance = self.getBalance(root)

        # Balance the tree
        if balance > 1:
            if key < root.left.value:
                return self.rightRotate(root)
            else:
                root.left = self.leftRotate(root.left)
                return self.rightRotate(root)

        if balance < -1:
            if key > root.right.value:
                return self.leftRotate(root)
            else:
                root.right = self.rightRotate(root.right)
                return self.leftRotate(root)

        return root

    def getHeight(self, node):
        if not node:
            return 0
        return node.height

    def getBalance(self, node):
        if not node:
            return 0
        return self.getHeight(node.left) - self.getHeight(node.right)

    # Left Rotate and Right Rotate functions
    # (Implement these methods for balancing)

# Usage
avl_tree = AVLTree()
root = None
for key in [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 25]:
    root = avl_tree.insert(root, key)
```

### 4. Summary
The key tasks in AVL trees are conducting standard binary search tree operations while ensuring the tree remains balanced through rotations. To delve deeper into AVL trees, you can look for detailed tutorials or examples, which cover rotations, tree height calculation, and deletion processes.
