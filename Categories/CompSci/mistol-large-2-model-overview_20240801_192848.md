# MISTOL Large 2 Model Overview

### What is the MISTOL Large 2 Model and How to Develop with It

The MISTOL Large 2 model, which was recently released, is a next-generation language model designed for various applications, including code generation, mathematics, and reasoning. 

#### Key Features:
- **Size and Context**: It has 123 billion parameters and supports a context window of 128k, which enables it to handle long context applications effectively.
- **Multilingual Support**: The model can understand and generate text in several languages including French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Hindi, and more.
- **Performance**: MISTOL Large 2 has demonstrated significant improvements over its predecessor, making it highly competitive with leading models such as GPT-4 and Llama 3.1.
- **Licensing**: It is open-source under the MISTOL research license, allowing for usage and modification for research and non-commercial applications. Commercial use, however, requires a separate license and self-deployment.

#### Developing with MISTOL Large 2:
1. **Access the Model**: Since it is an open-source model, you can get access to the code and parameters appropriate for research and non-commercial applications.
   
2. **Installation and Setup**: You'll need to set up an environment that includes the necessary libraries and dependencies for running MISTOL Large 2. This typically includes installing Python and libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

3. **Utilizing Code Generation**: The model is particularly effective for coding tasks. You can generate scripts, applications, or even iterate on existing code. Here's how you can get started:
   - Write prompts for the model to accomplish specific coding tasks.
   - Test the outputs in a development environment, such as Visual Studio Code.
   - Refine the prompts based on the performance of the code output.

4. **Evaluation**: After testing your generated code, evaluate its performance with benchmarks relevant to your project needs, especially focusing on its capabilities in reasoning and problem-solving.

5. **Contributions and Community**: Engage with the broader developer community focused on MISTOL Large 2 and contribute to discussions, improvements, and troubleshooting smaller issues as they arise.
