Certainly! Here's a Python function that calculates the factorial of a given number and prints the result for the input `5`:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n < 0:
        return "Factorial is not defined for negative numbers."
    elif n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        result = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            result *= i
        return result

# Calculate and print the factorial of 5
result = factorial(5)
print("The factorial of 5 is:", result)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `factorial` takes an integer `n` as its argument.
2. **Base Cases**: It checks if `n` is negative (returns an error message) and handles the case where `n` is 0 (returns 1, since 0! = 1).
3. **Calculation**: For positive integers, it uses a loop to multiply all integers from 1 to `n`, storing the cumulative result in `result`.
4. **Return**: Finally, it returns the calculated factorial.
5. **Output**: It then calls the function with the value `5` and prints the result.

When you run this code, it will output:

```
The factorial of 5 is: 120
```

You can easily modify the input number in the function call to calculate the factorial for different values. If you have any questions about the implementation or need further modifications, feel free to ask!
