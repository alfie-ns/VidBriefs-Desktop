In your coding interviews, you should mention the following algorithms, as these are considered essential:

### Search Algorithms
1. **Binary Search**: Efficient for finding an element in a sorted list with a time complexity of \(O(\log n)\).
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Useful for traversing or searching through tree and graph structures, with a time complexity of \(O(V + E)\).
3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Another traversal method for trees and graphs, also with a time complexity of \(O(V + E)\).

### Sorting Algorithms
4. **Insertion Sort**: Simple and efficient for small or mostly sorted lists, with a best-case complexity of \(O(n)\) and worst-case of \(O(n^2)\).
5. **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that works efficiently for larger lists, with a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\).
6. **Quick Sort**: A fast sorting algorithm on average, with a best-case complexity of \(O(n \log n)\) and worst-case of \(O(n^2)\), but is generally faster than merge sort when implemented well.

### Special Algorithm
7. **Greedy Algorithms**: Used for optimization problems where making the locally optimal choice at each stage leads to a globally optimal solution, although not guaranteed.

Familiarize yourself with their use cases, time complexities, and practical applications to discuss them effectively during your interviews.
