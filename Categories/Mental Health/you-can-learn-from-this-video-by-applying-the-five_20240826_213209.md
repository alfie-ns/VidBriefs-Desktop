You can learn from this video by applying the five strategic mental models derived from chess to your own life and decision-making processes:

1. **Control the Center**: Identify the key areas in your life (such as health, career, or relationships) that can give you the most influence and prioritize them. Focus on foundational aspects that will have a significant impact.

2. **Understand the True Value of a Piece**: Recognize the strengths and capabilities of the people around you, including yourself. Delegate tasks based on individual strengths and ensure you're leveraging the right resources to solve problems.

3. **Position Before Submission**: Focus on establishing a strong foundation and position before trying to achieve your end goals. This means investing time in building the right environment or resources before seeking immediate results.

4. **Own the Initiative**: Take proactive steps in your life to drive momentum. Understand that maintaining that momentum is often easier than achieving it in the first place, so choose actions that build long-term progress.

5. **Find the Hardest Move**: Be open to unconventional solutions, such as retreating or changing direction when necessary. Sometimes stepping back can provide clarity and open new pathways for progress.

By integrating these mental models into your daily decision-making, you can enhance your judgment and improve outcomes in both personal and professional areas of your life. Reflect on specific decisions you face and apply these frameworks to analyze your options comprehensively.
