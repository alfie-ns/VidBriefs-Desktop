# Neuralink's Link App Overview

The **Link app** created by Neuralink is designed to facilitate interaction between a user's brain and a computer. Here’s how it generally works:

1. **Calibration**: Users undergo a calibration process to develop a model that translates brain activity into cursor movements. This calibration typically involves following a cursor (which moves independently) as it targets bubbles on the screen. During this phase, the app collects signals that help it learn the user's intentions. The more time spent calibrating, the better the accuracy of the model.

2. **Body Mapping and Data Collection**: The app contains features like body mapping that helps track neural activity and performance over time. Users engage in daily tasks or data collection to ensure the Neuralink implant performs optimally.

3. **Cursor Control**: Once calibration is complete, control moves to a “closed loop” mode where users can directly manipulate the cursor based on their thoughts. This phase provides feedback, allowing users to see how effectively they can target bubbles or icons on the screen.

4. **Difficulty Play Testing**: Users may engage in games (like Snake) to assess the effectiveness of the model, allowing them to gauge the performance and make necessary adjustments.

5. **Connection to Computer**: The Link app connects to a computer via a charger which also helps wake the implant from its hibernation mode.

6. **Feedback and Improvement**: Users can provide feedback to improve the calibration process and user experience. The system adapts based on performance, aiming for consistent improvement.

While there's still much to learn and improve regarding the interface and efficiency, the Link app provides an innovative way to connect cognitive functions with digital interfaces.
