# “Who’s the Best Heavyweight Fighter?”

Determining "who's really the best" in combat sports, especially among heavyweights in the UFC, often comes down to personal opinion and preference. However, based on the information provided in the transcript, Tom Aspinall has made a compelling case for himself as one of the top contenders in the division.

Aspinall's impressive attributes include:

- **Speed and Agility**: He moves remarkably quickly for a heavyweight and demonstrates exceptional striking with a diverse skill set.
- **Finishing Ability**: With a 100% finish rate, he has shown that he can end fights decisively, often in the early rounds.
- **Versatility**: His ability to adapt mid-fight, combine striking and grappling techniques, and learn from defeats highlights his growth and potential.
- **Recent Success**: Winning the interim UFC heavyweight belt and achieving multiple performance bonuses showcases his current prominence in the sport.

While Jon Jones is currently an influential figure in the heavyweight division, Aspinall’s rapid rise and continued improvement indicate that he could be a future champion as he challenges the status quo and aims for unification bouts.
