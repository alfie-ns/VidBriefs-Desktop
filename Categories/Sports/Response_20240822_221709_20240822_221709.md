I currently don't have real-time web browsing capabilities to check the latest events directly. However, as of my last update, the most recent Olympic Games held were in Tokyo in 2021, where the gold medalist in the men's 100m final was Marcell Jacobs of Italy, and in the women's 100m final, the gold medalist was Elaine Thompson-Herah of Jamaica.

For the most recent Olympic Games or updates, I recommend checking a reliable sports news website, the official Olympics website, or your preferred sports news source. If thereâ€™s something specific you would like to know about past Olympic events or any athlete, feel free to ask!
