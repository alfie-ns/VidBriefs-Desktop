To analyze how you can sell old DVDs to make money, let's break the process down into several key steps: assessment of value, pricing, costs, and sales channels.

### 1. Assessing the Value of DVDs
- **Condition:** Check if the DVDs are in good condition (no scratches, original cases, etc.).
- **Demand:** Research which DVDs are still popular or collector’s items. Websites like eBay, Amazon, or specialized DVD sites can provide insights into current prices and demand.
- **Genre and Rarity:** Certain genres (e.g., classics, cult movies, or TV series) might fetch higher prices.

### 2. Pricing Strategy
- **Market Research:** Look up similar DVDs’ listings on various online platforms to gauge a competitive price.
- **Base Pricing on Condition:** Set prices based on condition (e.g., “Like New,” “Good,” “Acceptable”). A useful formula might be:
  
  \[
  \text{Selling Price} = \text{Market Average Price} - \text{Depreciation}
  \]

  Where depreciation can be based on the DVD's condition.

### 3. Cost Analysis
- **Selling Costs:** Consider costs like shipping, listing fees (if applicable on platforms), or packaging supplies. Include these in your pricing.
- **Time Investment:** Factor in the time spent taking photos, writing descriptions, and managing listings. This might not have a direct monetary cost, but it's important to consider your time as an investment.

### 4. Choosing Sales Channels
- **Online Marketplaces:** Options include eBay, Amazon, Facebook Marketplace, or specialized sites like Decluttr.
- **Local Sales:** Consider garage sales, flea markets, or local thrift stores.
- **Consignment:** You could also approach local shops that may sell used DVDs on consignment.

### 5. Marketing Strategy
- **Descriptive Listings:** Write clear, concise descriptions and take quality photos.
- **Promotions:** Offer discounts for bulk purchases or special deals to attract more buyers.

### Example Calculation
Suppose you have 20 DVDs with an average market price of $8 each:

1. **Total Potential Revenue:**
   \[
   20 \times 8 = 160\, \text{USD}
   \]

2. **Cost Breakdown (e.g., $2 per DVD for shipping/fees):**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost of Selling} = 20 \times 2 = 40\, \text{USD}
   \]

3. **Net Profit:**
   \[
   \text{Net Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 160 - 40 = 120\, \text{USD}
   \]

### Conclusion
By carefully analyzing the market value, pricing your DVDs effectively, and choosing the right sales channels, you can maximize your return on investment.
