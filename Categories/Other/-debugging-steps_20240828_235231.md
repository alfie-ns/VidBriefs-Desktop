I understand your frustration, and I appreciate your patience. Here are some possible reasons for the previous oversight of providing US books instead of UK ones:

1. **Default Response Settings**: The search or recommendation might default to a broader market, which can include US listings, especially when the request isnâ€™t explicitly location-specific.

2. **Misinterpretation of Context**: The initial query may have lacked clear geographical context, leading to a generic response.

3. **Limited Data Recognition**: At times, the system might prioritize availability or popularity in a wider market, inadvertently leading to suggestions not suitable for a specific region.

### Debugging Steps

To improve accuracy in the future:
- **Clarification**: Clearly specify the location in queries, especially when looking for region-specific content.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Provide feedback on specific needs (like preferred regions) to adjust future responses accordingly.
