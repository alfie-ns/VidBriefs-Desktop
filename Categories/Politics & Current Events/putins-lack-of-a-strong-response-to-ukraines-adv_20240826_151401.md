Putin's lack of a strong response to Ukraine's advances into Russian territory may be attributed to several factors:

1. **Military Strategy and Performance**: Analysts, like Kimberly Dozier, suggest that the Russian military has been slow to respond and has failed to effectively counter Ukraine's advances. This raises questions about Russia's operational capabilities and strategic decisions.

2. **Public Opinion**: There are indications that Putin may be hesitant to mobilize more troops or take more aggressive actions due to concerns about domestic backlash. Most Russians might not support a full-scale mobilization unless they feel directly threatened.

3. **Risk of Escalation**: Increasing pressure on Ukraine could provoke a stronger military or even nuclear response from Russia if vital interests are threatened. This calculation may lead Putin to avoid drastic measures for now.

4. **Political Considerations**: Some experts argue that Putin may be using the situation in Kursk strategically to consolidate his power narrative in Russia. By portraying Ukraine as a threat, he can justify existing policies and maintain state control over the narrative.

5. **Manpower and Resources**: Engaging in a broader conflict requires significant resources and manpower, which Russia may be reluctant to commit, especially when stretched across multiple fronts, including the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine.

Overall, Putin's cautious approach reflects a complex mix of military, political, and social considerations that impact his decision-making process.
