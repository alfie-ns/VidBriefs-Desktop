As of now, it's still early in the electoral cycle for the 2024 United States presidential election, but several factors indicate potential candidates and their current standings:

1. **Donald Trump**: He is a leading candidate in the Republican primaries and has maintained a strong base of support, particularly among his loyalist voters. Current polls often show him at the forefront of expected nominees.

2. **Joe Biden**: As the incumbent president, Biden is likely to run for reelection, but his approval ratings and approval from his party will play crucial roles in his campaign's strength.

3. **Other Candidates**: In addition to Trump and Biden, there are several other candidates, such as Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and potential third-party candidates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Jill Stein. Their emergence could shift election dynamics.

Polling data and political analysts suggest that while Trump has a significant chance to secure the Republican nomination, Biden will likely remain a strong contender for the Democrats, given his incumbency.

The landscape can quickly change with new developments, debates, and public sentiment as the election date approaches.
