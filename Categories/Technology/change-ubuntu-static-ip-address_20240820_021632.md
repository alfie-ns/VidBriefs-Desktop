Here's a step-by-step manual to change a static IP address in Ubuntu, based on the information provided in the video. 

## Step-by-Step Manual to Change a Static IP Address in Ubuntu

### Requirements:
- Ubuntu installed on a virtual machine (using VirtualBox as shown in the video)
- PuTTY installed on your Windows machine to access the Ubuntu virtual machine

### Steps:

1. **Open VirtualBox**: Start your Ubuntu virtual machine.

2. **Log into Ubuntu**: 
   - Use your credentials to access the system.
   - You can also log in via PuTTY using the IP address of your Ubuntu machine.

3. **Check Current IP Address**:
   - Enter the command:
     ```
     ip a
     ```
   - This command shows all network interfaces and their current configurations.

4. **Install Required Tools**:
   - If the `ifconfig` command is unavailable, install the net-tools package:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install net-tools
     ```

5. **Locate the Network Configuration File**:
   - Navigate to the `/etc/netplan` directory to find the configuration files:
     ```bash
     cd /etc/netplan
     ```

6. **Backup Configuration File**:
   - Itâ€™s a good practice to create a backup of the configuration file before modifying it:
     ```bash
     sudo cp 50-cloud-init.yaml 50-cloud-init.yaml.bak
     ```

7. **Edit the Configuration File**:
   - Open the configuration file in a text editor (e.g., `nano` or `vim`):
     ```bash
     sudo nano 50-cloud-init.yaml
     ```
   - Change the `dhcp` setting to `false` and set your desired static IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS as follows:
     ```yaml
     network:
       version: 2
       ethernets:
         your_network_interface_name:
           addresses:
             - 192.168.1.90/24
           gateway4: 192.168.1.1
           nameservers:
             addresses:
               - 8.8.8.8
               - 8.8.4.4
     ```
   
8. **Save and Exit**: 
   - For `nano`, press `CTRL + X`, then `Y`, and hit `ENTER` to save changes.

9. **Create a Disable Configuration File (to prevent reverting)**:
   - Create another file to disable automatic network management:
     ```bash
     sudo touch /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg
     echo "network: {config: disabled}" | sudo tee -a /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg
     ```

10. **Apply the Changes**:
    - Apply the new configuration using:
      ```bash
      sudo netplan apply
      ```
    - Alternatively, you can use:
      ```bash
      sudo netplan try
      ```
    - This command allows you to test the configuration before applying it permanently.

11. **Verify Changes**:
    - Check if your IP address has changed:
      ```bash
      ip a
      ```
    - Ensure your new static IP is listed.

12. **Troubleshoot Errors**:
    - If you encounter any errors during the application, re-edit the configuration file, ensuring proper indentation and formatting, and try again.

13. **Reconnect Using PuTTY** (If disconnected):
    - Open a new PuTTY session using the new static IP address to verify the connection is successful.

14. **Keep Updated**:
    - Subscribe to channels or newsletters to stay informed on best practices for managing your server environments.

### Conclusion
By following these steps, you should successfully change a static IP address in your Ubuntu installation. Ensure to test connectivity after making changes and troubleshoot any issues that may arise following modifications to the network settings.
