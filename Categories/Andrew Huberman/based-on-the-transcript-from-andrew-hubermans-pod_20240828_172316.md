Based on the transcript from Andrew Huberman's podcast, the following protocols and tools for studying and learning have been mentioned:

1. **Sleep Optimization**: Ensure adequate quality and quantity of sleep to enhance focus and retention.
  
2. **Mindfulness Meditation**: Practice brief daily mindfulness meditation (5 to 10 minutes) to improve attention and memory.

3. **Testing Yourself**: Use self-testing as a studying tool soon after learning new material to enhance retention and offset forgetting.

4. **Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)**: Incorporate NSDR practices or Yoga Nidra to restore mental and physical vigor, especially when sleep isn't optimal.

5. **Focused Study Sessions**: Set aside dedicated, scheduled times for studying without distractions to improve engagement and retention.

6. **Interleaving Information**: Occasionally intermingle the study material with related but different information to enhance overall learning.

7. **Active Engagement**: Actively focus and alert your mind by considering the importance of the material you are studying.

8. **Gap Effects**: Take short breaks during the learning process to allow for the hippocampus to replay the information, enhancing retention.

9. **Teaching Others**: Teach peers about the material youâ€™ve learned to reinforce your understanding and mastery.

10. **Maintaining a Quiet Environment**: Eliminate distractions (e.g., putting away phones) while studying to increase focus.

These protocols are aimed at improving learning efficacy and memory retention based on the principles of neuroplasticity discussed in the podcast. For further exploration of these topics and tools, listeners are encouraged to refer to resources provided in Huberman Lab's online platforms and newsletters.
