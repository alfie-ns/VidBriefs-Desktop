# "Pereira's Full Distance Opponents"

Oops, my bad! You're right, no lightweights went the distance against Pereira. Let's straighten that out. Here are the fighters who did manage to go the full distance with Alex Pereira in the game:

1. **Yahya Hall (Middleweight)**
2. **Robbie Lawler (Middleweight)**
3. **Darren Till (Middleweight)**

These guys managed to survive all rounds without getting knocked out. Thanks for catching that, and if you have any more questions or need any other info, feel free to ask!
