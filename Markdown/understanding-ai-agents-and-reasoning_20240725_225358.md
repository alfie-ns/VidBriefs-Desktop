# "Understanding AI Agents and Reasoning"

Based on the transcript, an "agent" refers to a type of AI system that incorporates a large language model (LLM) at its core and is designed to independently solve problems by reasoning and taking actions. This concept emerges from the transition from using standalone models to creating more complex, modular systems known as compound AI systems.

Here are the key characteristics of an AI agent as described in the transcript:

1. **Reasoning Ability**: An agent has the capability to break down complex problems into manageable steps. It can think through various aspects of a task and create a strategy to achieve a solution.

2. **Action Capability**: Agents can interact with external tools, which could include APIs, databases, or other software components. They determine when and how to utilize these tools effectively to implement their plans.

3. **Memory Access**: Agents can store and recall past interactions or logs of their reasoning process, allowing for more personalized and context-aware responses in future interactions.

4. **Control Logic**: Unlike more straightforward systems that follow pre-defined paths strictly, agents can adapt their approach based on the situation. They can adjust their plans as new information becomes available or if errors occur during their execution.

5. **Flexibility in Problem Solving**: Agents are particularly useful for complex, dynamic tasks where rigid programming would be inefficient. They can explore multiple paths to find solutions rather than following a singular approach.

The transcript illustrates how agents increase the potential for autonomy in AI systems, making them more capable of handling a wide range of queries and tasks, particularly when those tasks are complex or not easily defined.
