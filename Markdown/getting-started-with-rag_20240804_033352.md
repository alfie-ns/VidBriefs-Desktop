# Getting Started with RAG

To get started with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) right now, you can follow these steps based on the detailed instructions from the video, [Introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://youtu.be/_5Cs1mcg0DM?si=KHUBovuokwBa24Qi):

## Step-by-Step Guide to Set Up RAG

### 1. **Set Up Your Development Environment**
   - **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
   - **Choose a Code Editor**: It's recommended to use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or any other code editor you're comfortable with.
   - **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:
     ```bash
     python -m venv rag-env
     source rag-env/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
     rag-env\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
     ```

### 2. **Install Required Packages**
   Open your command line or terminal and install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install openai chromadb
   ```
   If you're using additional libraries such as for PDF reading or other purposes, you can install them as well:
   ```bash
   pip install PyPDF2 pandas sentence-transformers langchain
   ```

### 3. **Create an OpenAI Account**
   - Go to [OpenAI's website](https://openai.com/) and sign up for an account if you don’t already have one.
   - Generate an API key through the OpenAI dashboard. You will use this key in your code to connect with OpenAI's services.

### 4. **Set Up Your Project Structure**
   - Create a project folder, for example, `rag-project`.
   - Inside this folder, create an `app.py` file where your main code will reside.
   - Also, consider creating a `.env` file to securely store your OpenAI API key.

### 5. **Implement the RAG System**
   You can follow the examples and code snippets provided in the video:
   - Load and preprocess your documents.
   - Create embeddings for your documents and store them in a vector database (like ChromaDB).
   - Implement the retrieval process where you transform queries into vector embeddings, retrieve relevant documents, and generate responses using the OpenAI model.

### 6. **Try Example Code**
   You can start coding based on the walkthrough in the video or adapt the following basic structure for your `app.py`:

   ```python
   import os
   import openai
   from chromadb import Client
   from your_embedding_function import create_embeddings  # Custom function

   # Load your OpenAI API key
   openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

   # Function to load your data
   def load_documents():
       # Insert logic to load your documents here
       return []

   # Set up your Chroma client
   client = Client()
   collection = client.get_or_create_collection(name="my_collection")

   # Load documents and create embeddings
   documents = load_documents()
   embeddings = create_embeddings(documents)

   # Insert your embeddings into the Chroma database
   for doc, embedding in zip(documents, embeddings):
       collection.add(doc, embedding)

   # Query your data
   query = "What is the capital of France?"
   # Insert your querying logic and generation code here
   ```

### 7. **Run Your Application**
   With everything set up, simply run your application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### 8. **Iterate and Experiment**
   Start experimenting with different queries and document sets. Modify your embedding methods or try different pre-processing techniques to see how it affects the results.

## Additional Resources
- **Learn More**: If you want to enhance your understanding, consider exploring more advanced topics on RAG, embedding techniques, and refining prompts.
- **Follow Tutorials**: Look for tutorials or courses that continue from the basics you've learned to dive deeper into specific aspects of RAG or related technologies.

By following these steps, you’ll be set up and ready to start building and experimenting with your own RAG system! If you encounter any issues, refer to the video for specific code snippets and clarifications.
