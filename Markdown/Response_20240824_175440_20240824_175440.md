To analyze the division of \( 3243 \div 11 \), we can perform the calculation and examine the result.

### Calculation
1. **Perform the Division:**
   - Dividing \( 3243 \) by \( 11 \):
   
   \[
   3243 \div 11 = 294.8181\ldots
   \]

   - This shows that \( 3243 \) is not evenly divisible by \( 11 \).

2. **Finding Quotient and Remainder:**
   - Using integer division, the quotient is \( 294 \) (the whole number part).
   - To find the remainder, we can use the formula:
   
   \[
   R = D - (Q \times d)
   \]
   
   where:
   - \( D \) is the dividend (3243),
   - \( Q \) is the quotient (294),
   - \( d \) is the divisor (11).
   
   Calculating the remainder:

   \[
   R = 3243 - (294 \times 11) = 3243 - 3234 = 9
   \]

### Summary of Results
- **Quotient:** \( 294 \)
- **Remainder:** \( 9 \)

Thus, the division of \( 3243 \) by \( 11 \) gives:
\[
\text{Result} = 294 \quad \text{(whole number)}
\]
\[
\text{Remainder} = 9
\]

### Conclusion
- The division \( 3243 \div 11 \) produces a quotient of \( 294 \) with a remainder of \( 9 \). Therefore, \( 3243 \) can be expressed as:
\[
3243 = (11 \times 294) + 9
\]
