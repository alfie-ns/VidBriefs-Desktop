It seems that you encountered an error while attempting to browse a website, specifically the "Invalid URL" error, which indicates that the URL you provided is missing a proper scheme (like "http://" or "https://"). The error message suggests that you might need to prepend the correct URL scheme to the address, as illustrated in the example of converting "on the web for some stuff" to "https://on the web for some stuff".

**Key Points:**

- The error arises when a URL is not formatted correctly, specifically lacking a web scheme.
- To resolve this issue, ensure that any URL you enter includes a scheme (e.g., "http://" or "https://").

**Insights:**

- Always check your URLs before entering them to avoid this common error.
- Familiarizing yourself with URL structures can help in understanding how to troubleshoot similar issues in the future.
- If you're trying to access a specific resource, make sure to verify the correct URL from reliable sources to avoid errors.

If you need guidance on using URLs in a specific context or with certain tools (like Pythonâ€™s `requests` library), feel free to ask!
