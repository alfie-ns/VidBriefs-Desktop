Here are the 10 advanced Python features discussed in the video:

1. **Advanced Unpacking Methods**: Utilizing unpacking with iterable objects and the asterisk (`*`) operator for collecting multiple elements.

2. **Ignoring Values Using Anonymous Variables**: Using the underscore (`_`) as an anonymous variable to ignore values during unpacking.

3. **Unpacking Nested Structures**: Handling nested tuples or lists by using parentheses to unpack.

4. **Unpacking in Function Arguments**: Using the asterisk operator to accept multiple positional arguments in a function.

5. **Combining Lists with the Asterisk Operator**: Unpacking lists into individual elements using the asterisk operator for combining and printing.

6. **Swapping Variables Using Unpacking**: Swapping variable values in a single line using tuple unpacking.

7. **Dynamic Code Execution**: Using `exec` and `eval` functions to execute dynamically generated code.

8. **Function and Variable Annotations**: Adding type annotations to functions and variables for better documentation and clarity.

9. **Creating Context Managers**:Using the `with` statement to manage resources like files, ensuring they are properly opened and closed.

10. **Generators and the Itertools Library**: Using generators for efficient iteration and memory usage, and leveraging the `itertools` library for advanced iterator functions.

These features provide a deeper understanding and more powerful capabilities when programming in Python.
