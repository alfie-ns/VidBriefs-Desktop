On August 24, 2024, Russia and Ukraine conducted a significant prisoner swap involving 115 prisoners from each side, coinciding with Ukraine's Independence Day. This marked the first exchange since Ukraine's recent offensive into Russia's Kursk region, which began earlier in August.

### Key Details:
- **Mediate Role:** The United Arab Emirates facilitated the exchange, which is notable as it has previously mediated several swaps between the two nations.
- **Who Was Released:** The Ukrainian side consisted of conscripted servicemen, some of whom had been captured during the early months of Russiaâ€™s invasion. Notably, nearly 50 of those exchanged were defenders from the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol.
- **Russian Soldiers:** The Russian Defense Ministry stated that the returned soldiers had been captured during the conflict in the Kursk region and would receive rehabilitation and medical treatment in Belarus before returning to Russia.
- **Ukrainian Response:** President Volodymyr Zelenskyy celebrated the exchange and shared images of the returning servicemen, expressing commitment to continue efforts to recover all Ukrainian prisoners. 

This swap reflects ongoing negotiations and the continued human toll of the conflict, highlighting both nations' efforts to repatriate their personnel amid the prolonged war. The loss and suffering of prisoners of war have been emphasized by international observers, with concerns about their treatment in captivity.
