To analyze the multiplication of \( 3894 \times 11 \), we can perform the calculation step-by-step.

### Calculation Steps

1. **Break down the multiplication**: 
   We can use the distributive property for easier calculation:
   \[
   3894 \times 11 = 3894 \times (10 + 1) = 3894 \times 10 + 3894 \times 1
   \]
   
2. **Calculate each part**:
   - \( 3894 \times 10 = 38940 \)
   - \( 3894 \times 1 = 3894 \)

3. **Add the results**:
   \[
   38940 + 3894 = 42834
   \]

### Conclusion
Therefore, the result of \( 3894 \times 11 \) is **42834**.

### Verification using Python Code
