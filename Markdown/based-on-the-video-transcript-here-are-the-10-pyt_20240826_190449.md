Based on the video transcript, here are the 10 Python concepts mentioned:

1. **Creating Python Files:** Using the `.py` extension to create Python scripts.
2. **Variables:** Defining variables and assigning values.
3. **Data Types:** Understanding basic data types such as integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
4. **Type Annotations:** Using type annotations to clarify variable types for better error checking.
5. **Constants:** Defining constants using uppercase naming conventions and type annotations.
6. **Functions:** Creating reusable code with functions, including parameters and return values.
7. **Classes:** Defining classes as blueprints for objects, including initializers and attributes.
8. **Methods:** Adding methods inside classes for behavior, using the `self` keyword to reference instance attributes.
9. **Dunder Methods:** Special methods (double underscore methods) like `__str__` and `__add__` to customize object behavior.
10. **Emphasis on Further Learning:** Encouragement to study these concepts more thoroughly through research and additional resources.
