It looks like the error message you're dealing with, "`video_id` must be a string," is often encountered in programming contexts, particularly when working with APIs like YouTube's. This suggests that a function or method expected a string value for the `video_id`, but received a different type, such as an integer or None.

To help you understand this better, here’s a brief overview of how you might handle this situation when programming:

### Fixing the Error

1. **Ensure Data Types**: When assigning values to variables, make sure that you're passing a string for the `video_id`. For example:
   ```python
   video_id = 12345  # Incorrect
   video_id = "12345"  # Correct
   ```

2. **Debugging the Source**: If you're fetching `video_id` from an API response or a database, ensure that it's being extracted correctly. For instance:
   ```python
   response = some_api_call()
   video_id = response['id']  # Ensure 'id' contains a string
   ```

3. **Type Conversion**: If you suspect the variable might not be a string, convert it explicitly:
   ```python
   video_id = str(video_id)  # Converts to string if not already
   ```

4. **Check Input Parameters**: If this is part of a function, check how you're passing in the `video_id`:
   ```python
   def get_video_details(video_id):
       if not isinstance(video_id, str):
           raise ValueError("video_id must be a string")
   ```

### Learning Resources
- **API Documentation**: Look at the official documentation for the API you're using (like YouTube's Data API) to see expected formats.
- **Error Handling**: Learn basic error handling in Python to manage issues gracefully.
