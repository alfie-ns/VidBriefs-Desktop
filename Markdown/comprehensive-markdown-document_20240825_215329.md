## Introduction
This document serves as a comprehensive guide to Markdown syntax. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text using plain text characters. It's widely used for README files, documentation, and blogging.

## Basic Syntax

### Headings
Headings are defined using the `#` symbol. The number of `#` symbols determines the heading level:

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```

### Paragraphs

Paragraphs are created by separating blocks of text with a blank line.

This is a new paragraph.

### Line Breaks

To create a line break, end a line with two or more spaces and press return.

This is the first line.
This is the second line.

### Emphasis

You can emphasize text using asterisks or underscores.

- *Italic* text
- **Bold** text
- ***Bold and italic*** text

## Lists

### Ordered Lists

Ordered lists are created using numbers followed by periods:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Unordered Lists

Unordered lists are created using asterisks, plus signs, or hyphens:

- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item

### Nested Lists

You can create nested lists by indenting:

1. First item
   - Subitem A
   - Subitem B
2. Second item

## Links and Images

### Hyperlinks

Create hyperlinks using the following syntax:

[OpenAI](https://www.openai.com) is amazing!

### Images

To add images, use a similar syntax:

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes are used to indicate quoted text. They are created using the greater than symbol:

> This is a blockquote.
>
> - It can span multiple lines.

## Code Blocks

### Inline Code

Inline code is wrapped in backticks:

Use the `printf()` function in C.

### Fenced Code Blocks

Fenced code blocks are created using three backticks or tildes:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

## Tables

Tables can be created using pipes and hyphens:

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Row 1    | Data 1   | Data 2   |
| Row 2    | Data 3   | Data 4   |

## Footnotes

Footnotes can be created using brackets and a caret:

This is a footnote reference[^1].

[^1]: This is the footnote text.
