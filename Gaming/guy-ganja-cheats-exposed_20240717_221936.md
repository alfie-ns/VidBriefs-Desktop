# "Guy Ganja Cheats Exposed"

The person in the video, presumably "Guy Ganja," was exposed in several ways:

1. **Admission of Cheating**: The dialogue heavily focuses on the use of exploits and cheats in the game. "Guy Ganja" repeatedly acknowledges using glitches and exploits such as "clinch spam," "stamina drain glitches," and other techniques generally considered unfair or unsporting in competitive play. This admission itself is an exposure as it confirms he reached a high rank through unsanctioned means.

2. **Failed Defenses**: The video includes multiple instances where "Guy Ganja" fails to execute his known strategies effectively, indicating that his skills without the exploits are not sufficient to compete at the highest levels.

3. **Behavioral Exposure**: The exchanges show "Guy Ganja" becoming increasingly frustrated and defensive, using profanities and getting agitated during the game. This behavior can be seen as exposing his insecurity and reliance on the glitches for competitive advantage.

4. **Technical Difficulties**: Throughout the video, there are moments where "Guy Ganja" struggles with his controller and mentions issues with his setup, which implies a reliance on technical configurations to enhance his gameplay artificially.

5. **Quitting the Match**: At the end of the video, "Guy Ganja" quits the match. Rage quitting can be interpreted as an admission of defeat, reinforcing the idea that he cannot sustain his gameplay without resorting to glitches.

In conclusion, "Guy Ganja" is exposed through a combination of his own admissions, underperformance without exploits, erratic behavior, technical reliance, and ultimately quitting the match, all of which highlight the discrepancy between his true skill level and his rank achieved through cheating.
